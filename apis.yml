      FordConnect allows to send vehicle commands (e.g., lock, unlock, etc.) and
      request vehicle information (e.g., fuel range, tire pressure, etc.) to
      Ford and Lincoln vehicles. The API enables FordPass and Lincoln Way
      customers to provide third-party applications access to their connected
      vehicles. FordConnect uses OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow and
      authorization scopes.

      configuration.
